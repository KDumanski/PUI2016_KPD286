1)Verify the hypotheses

  The null hypothesis is right if KPD286's meaning is that the ratio of man biking at night (between 9 pm to 5:59 am) compared to women is less than or equal than man biking during the day 6 am to 8:59 pm compared to women. And I failed to find the alternative hypothesis. 
  My suggestion is: the alternative hypothesis can be the ratio of man biking at night (between 9 pm to 5:59 am) compared to women is higher than man biking during the day 6 am to 8:59 pm compared to women.
  
2)Data

  It's good that the data of 'start time' has been converted to a datetime format. However, other useful data such as men biking at night or women biking at day is missing.
  My suggestion is: extract the data of women and men biking at night and day separately and then plot the ratio between them to figure out the outcome.
  
3)Test
  Use the Z-test
